# Level 11: Elevator

Date: January 31, 2026

## What Happened

Elevator asks me "Is this the last floor?" TWO times.

I lie differently each time.

First time: I say "No"
Second time: I say "Yes"

Elevator believes both. Sets top = true.

## How I Did It

Made a light switch (toggle).

Every time Elevator asks, I flip the switch.

Switch flips: ON → OFF → ON → OFF...

So my answers change: YES → NO → YES → NO...

Elevator gets two different answers. Gets confused. I win.

## The Fix

Don't ask twice. Ask once, remember the answer.

## What I Learned

You can lie to other contracts by changing your answer each time they ask.

11/29 done.
